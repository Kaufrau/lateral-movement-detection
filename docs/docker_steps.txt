Thanks for the detailed info — you're right to call it a chicken-and-egg situation. Based on everything you've shared, here's a clearer breakdown of the **core issue** and how to approach solving it *specifically for a VM setup*.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR: You're Running Docker in a VM Without Nested Virtualization Enabled

Docker Desktop with WSL2 requires **Hyper-V** features and **virtualization support**. You're in a **virtual machine (VM)**, and **nested virtualization is likely disabled** on the host.

The key error:

```
HCS_E_HYPERV_NOT_INSTALLED
```

means Docker can't start because **Hyper-V or virtualization extensions aren't available in the VM**.

---

## ✅ Fix Strategy

### 💡 Option 1: Enable Nested Virtualization (Recommended)

If you **control the host machine**, you need to **enable nested virtualization** for the VM.

#### 🖥️ If using **Hyper-V**:

Run this on the **host** machine (not inside the VM):

```powershell
Set-VMProcessor -VMName "YourVMName" -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
```

> Make sure the VM is **off** before running that command.

#### 🧰 If using **VMware Workstation/Player**:

1. Power off the VM.
2. Edit the `.vmx` file of your VM.
3. Add this line:

   ```ini
   hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = "FALSE"
   ```
4. Also add:

   ```ini
   vhv.enable = "TRUE"
   ```
5. Save and restart the VM.

#### 🖥️ If using **VirtualBox**:

1. Shut down the VM.
2. Run on the host:

   ```sh
   VBoxManage modifyvm "YourVMName" --nested-hw-virt on
   ```

Then reboot the VM and retry Docker Desktop.

---

### 🛠️ Option 2: Use Docker Without WSL2/Desktop (CLI-only)

If nested virtualization is **not possible** (e.g., cloud-hosted VM, or limited control), you can **still use Docker** via the legacy Docker CE/Linux setup.

#### ✔️ Install Docker with Linux Kernel (WSL not needed)

Install Docker like on a regular Linux system using a tool like [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) or via Linux VM/container.

Or if you're using a Windows VM:

* Install **Docker Toolbox** (uses VirtualBox VM internally)
* Or use **Minikube**, **Podman**, or **Colima** as Docker alternatives

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Use Linux VM Directly

If you're already in a VM, and WSL2 is blocked, running Docker directly inside a **Linux VM** (Ubuntu/Debian) is often simpler:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

That way, you're not relying on Docker Desktop or Windows/WSL at all.

## 🧪 Summary

| Option                       | Requires Host Access | Works in VM | Notes                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Enable Nested Virtualization | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes       | Best path to get Docker Desktop working     |
| Use Docker on Linux VM       | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes       | Lightweight, avoids Windows-specific issues |
| Docker Toolbox / Minikube    | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes       | Works without WSL/Hyper-V                   |
| Fix BIOS Access (F12, etc)   | ✅ Yes                | ❌ Maybe     | Very tricky in hosted/cloud setups          |

Would you like help checking which hypervisor you're using and how to enable nested virtualization on it? Or do you want to pivot to a Linux-based Docker setup?
